# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- master  # or change to your branch name

pool:
  vmImage: 'windows-latest'  # Use Windows since you're testing with Selenium + MSTest

steps:
- task: UseDotNet@2
  inputs:
    packageType: 'sdk'
    version: '8.0.x'  # or your project's .NET SDK version

- task: NuGetToolInstaller@1

- task: NuGetCommand@2
  inputs:
    restoreSolution: '**/*.sln'

- task: VSBuild@1
  inputs:
    solution: '**/*.sln'
    msbuildArgs: '/p:DeployOnBuild=true /p:Configuration=Release'

- task: VSTest@2
  inputs:
    testSelector: 'testAssemblies'
    testAssemblyVer2: |
      **\*test*.dll
      !**\*TestAdapter.dll
      !**\obj\**
    searchFolder: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)'
    runSettingsFile: 'QAS.runsettings'  # Make sure the file is committed
